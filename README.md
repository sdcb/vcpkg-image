# vcpkg-image

A small [Alpine] or [Ubuntu] Linux image with [gcc-10] and [vcpkg], plus prerequisites to install
packages such as `gmp`, `boost`, and `cgal`.

[vcpkg] is located in `/vcpkg` (available via `$VCPKG_ROOT`), and user-wide integration (`vcpkg integrate install`)
has been applied.
[vcpkg] is also required to use system-installed [CMake] and [Ninja] rather than downloading it's own copies.

As [vcpkg] requires [CMake] 3.21 or later, the latest stable version of [CMake] is downloaded and installed.

[CMake] projects should use:

```bash
"-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$VCPKG_ROOT/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
```

## Building

```bash
docker build -t vcpkg-image .
```

## Running

```bash
docker run -it --name vcpkg vcpkg-image
```
